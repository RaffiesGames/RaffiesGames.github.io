## Jounrey so far:
I'm a 3rd year CS student studying at SVCE, Sriperumbudur.
I started my gaming journey when I was around 4 years old when my sister introduced me to Pokemon Sapphire. Ever since then I've been hooked onto gaming. Later on through life, I found out that I'm pretty good with Math, Physics and Coding and that's when I decided that I wanted to be a Game Developer and give back to the community.

### Using C++ only:
* [Hand Cricket](https://github.com/raf1800/Hand-Cricket-Game)
